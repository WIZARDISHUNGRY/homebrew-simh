# Homebrew Simh

This tap contains formulae for [SIMH](http://simh.trailing-edge.com). Specifically this is to add NAT support for SIMH

## How do I install these formulae?

Just `brew tap wizardishungry/simh` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from Homebrew or another tap, you can `brew install WIZARDISHUNGRY/simh/simh`.

You can also install via URL:

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WIZARDISHUNGRY/homebrew-simh/master/simh.rb
```
